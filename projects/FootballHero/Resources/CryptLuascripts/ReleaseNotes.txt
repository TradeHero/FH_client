Server config for connecting to dev:
{"serverURL":"http://fhapi-dev1.cloudapp.net", "CDNserverURL":"http://portalvhdss3c1vgx5mrzv.blob.core.windows.net/fhdevsettings/", "useDev":true}

Server config for connecting to prod:
{"serverURL":"http://fhapi-prod1.cloudapp.net", "CDNserverURL":"http://portalvhdss3c1vgx5mrzv.blob.core.windows.net/fhsettings/", "useDev":false}


In case the server change is not downwards compatiable with old versions:
1. Set the server connect to dev and apply for Apple review. Since the version number is increased, the self-update won't be triggered.
2. Create the Android version and have it fully tested and ready for release.
3. After review is finished, create a self-update patch which will set the server to prod. Then release both the IOS and Android version.
